## üì¶ Installation

```bash
pip install context-compressor
```

*All features included by default - ML models, API service, integrations, and NLP processing.*

## üèÅ Quick Start

```python
from context_compressor import ContextCompressor

# Initialize with all features enabled
compressor = ContextCompressor()

# Compress text with impressive results
text = """
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries through machine learning,
natural language processing, and computer vision. These technologies enable
automated decision-making, predictive analytics, and intelligent automation
across healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment sectors.
"""

result = compressor.compress(text, target_ratio=0.5)

print(f"Original: {len(text)} characters")
print(f"Compressed: {len(result.compressed_text)} characters")
print(f"Quality Score: {result.quality_metrics.overall_score:.2f}")
print(f"Tokens Saved: {result.tokens_saved}")
```

## üéØ Use Cases

### RAG System Optimization
- Compress document chunks before embedding
- Reduce context window usage in retrieval

## üîå Framework Integrations

### LangChain
```python
from context_compressor.integrations.langchain import ContextCompressorTransformer

transformer = ContextCompressorTransformer(target_ratio=0.6)
compressed_docs = transformer.transform_documents(documents)
```

### OpenAI
```python
from context_compressor.integrations.openai import compress_for_openai

compressed_prompt = compress_for_openai(
    text=long_context,
    target_ratio=0.4,
    model="gpt-4"
)
```

### REST API
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/compress" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Your text...", "target_ratio": 0.5}'
```
